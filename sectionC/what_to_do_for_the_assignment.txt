 Section C: Problem-Solving
Instructions
Please select exactly one option.
Please choose any programming language that you are most comfortable
working with for this section (Remember, you may not choose the same
language that you chose in Section A).
You may not use any module, package, library or framework, whether
in-built or not, that directly solves the problem under the hood, e.g.
“sklearn.cluster.KMeans” module in Python.


Option 1: K-Means Algorithm

Please implement the K-means algorithm and meet the following requirements:
● For the dataset, generate the dataset using built-in tools from the
programming language. Use your preferred labels for the outputs.
● There should be two options to train the model: either train the model with
defaults for the number of iterations and the “k” value or accept user input
for the same values.
● Present your findings regarding the clusters, either using visualisations (for
this, pick any library you see fit) or by printing them in a tabular format.
● Pick any evaluation metric(s) you see fit and report on your findings.

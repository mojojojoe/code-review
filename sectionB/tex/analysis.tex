\section{Corporate takeovers in Africa
(2016-2021)}\label{corporate-takeovers-in-africa-2016-2021}}

    The data was aquired from Refinitiv for a legal firm in South Africa. It
reflects all corporate takeovers across Africa from 2016 onwards. There
is no quantitative data. The information is a listing containing the
names of the target and aquiror companies, their sectors and nation of
domicile. The analysis is done by differing groupings of the 6
categories and counting takeover listings (line numbers).

    This notebook is written in R. The libraries used are loaded first.

    Other than white space around entries (which should be cleaned up), the
data looks fine.

    To start with the analysis, look at the per nation acquisitions in
Africa. Only nations with 3 or more takeovers are considered.

    Seeing this it is apparent that the US (40), UK (31) and France (19) are
the 3 nations outside of Africa heavily involved in takeovers of African
companies. Other major takeover nations within Africa are Mauritius (13)
and South Africa (35). \emph{Possible reasons} Until recently South
Africa's economy was the largest in Africa, so their takeover tally
might be expected. Mauritius has drawn much invest in recent years due
to its very favourable tax laws. It could be that expatriated companies
are becoming involved in takeovers of African companies to domicile
themselves in Mauritius. The large number of takeovers from US, UK and
France may reflect the history between nations and also the value being
offered by African countries over the last 5 years.

Looking at the target nations: (only nations with 3 or more takeovers
are listed)

    Here, one can see that there are four major countries in Africa facing
the lion share of corporate takeovers. The nations are SA, Nigeria,
Egypt and Kenya. Between them South Africa has nearly 3 times the number
of takeovers as the second highest contender, Egypt and it takes the 2nd
(Egypt),3rd (Nigeria) and 4th (Kenya) contenders to match the number of
takeovers in South Africa. This seems to reflect a case of distress
amongst companies in South Africa, that there should be so many targeted
companies for takeover.

    Now, look at the country specific relation between acquiror and target
nations. Only nations with 3 or more takeovers are listed.

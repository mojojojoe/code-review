*Instructions*

- Please select exactly one option.
- Please use the prescribed programming languages and technologies.
(Remember, you may not choose the same language that you chose in
Section A).
- Deploy or publish your work as described in each option.



Option 2: Data Science
Please create a Jupyter notebook and find a dataset that meets the following
requirements:
● It has many features and rows, preferably a good mix of categorical and
continuous data.
● The dataset needs to be entirely new for you.
● Optionally don’t pick a dataset that is already perfect, as this will minimise
and take away from the steps you’d need to follow for this task.
You then need to:
● Read in the dataset.
● Clean the dataset, motivating your steps.
● Analyse the dataset, including appropriate visualisations.
● Note down all the findings and conclusions you’re making in a report at the
end.
● Create a blog post to document your findings.
